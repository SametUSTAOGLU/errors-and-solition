Solution-1

As it is stated in the Error message you have to "fetch first." This worked for me. Use the command:

1-git fetch origin main
Then follow these steps to merge:

2-git pull origin main
3-git add .
4-git commit -m 'your commit message'
5-git push origin main


Solution-2

1-  git push -f origin master
 this solution is not appropriate
